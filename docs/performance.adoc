# Performance History

Numbers reported by `cargo bench` as *nanoseconds per iter*. In other words, on my machine (MBP'15 i7), classifiying a given problem takes the time shown.

I keep these numbers mostly to track my own progress over time while playing with different Rust concepts (e.g., https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon[Rayon] or https://github.com/AdamNiederer/faster[Faster]).
