= Highlights

* can load trained https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm[libsvm] models (RBF-CSVM without sparse attributes)
* optimized for SIMD (using https://github.com/AdamNiederer/faster[Faster]) and threading (using https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon[Rayon])
* allocation-free during classification
* much faster than `libsvm`


= Principal Usage

Train with https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm[libsvm] (e.g., using the tool `svm-train`), then classify with `ffsvm-rust`.


= Status

**December 16, 2017**: We're in **PRE-ALPHA**. It will probably not even work on your machine.


= Performance History

Numbers reported by `cargo bench` as *nanoseconds per iter*. In other words, on my machine (MBP'15 i7), classifiying a given problem takes the time shown.

I keep these numbers mostly to track my own progress over time while playing with different Rust concepts (e.g., https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon[Rayon] or https://github.com/AdamNiederer/faster[Faster]).
