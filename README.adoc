= Highlights

* can load trained https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm[libSVM] models (currently binary RBF-CSVM without sparse attributes)
* optimized for SIMD (using https://github.com/AdamNiederer/faster[Faster]) and threading (using https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon[Rayon])
* allocation-free during classification
* much faster than `libsvm`


= Principal Usage

Train with https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm[libSVM] (e.g., using the tool `svm-train`), then classify with `ffsvm-rust`.
