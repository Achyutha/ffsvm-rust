# Highlights

* can load trained https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm[libsvm] models (RBF-CSVM without sparse attributes)
* optimized for SIMD (using https://github.com/AdamNiederer/faster[Faster]) and threading (using https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon[Rayon])
* allocation-free during classification
* much faster than `libsvm`


# Principal Usage

Train with `libsvm` (e.g., using the tool `svm-train`), then classify with `ffsvm-rust`.


# Status

**December 16, 2017**: `ffsvm-rust` is right now in **PRE-ALPHA**, which means it will probably not even work on your machine.


# Performance History

Numbers reported by `cargo bench` as *nanoseconds per iter*. In other words, on my machine (MBP 2015 i7), classifiying a given problem takes the time shown.

![benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.png)

I keep these numbers mostly to track my own progress over time while playing with different Rust concepts (e.g., [Rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) or [Faster](https://github.com/AdamNiederer/faster)).
